# partition-numbers

A simple program written to recursively find the Nth term of the [partition numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) (https://oeis.org/A000041), written as an extra-curricular school project, in Python

This is a surprisingly difficult problem, and the sequence's algebraic definition is much more complicated than its recursive definition.
